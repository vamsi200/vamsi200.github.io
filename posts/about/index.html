        "content": "Recommended Books for Personal and Professional Growth Here is a list of books I highly recommend for anyone looking to grow personally and professionally. These books cover a variety of topics, from technology and cybersecurity to philosophy and self-improvement. I will keep this list updated with new reads.\n1. The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt \u0026amp; David Thomas A must-read for every software developer. This book is packed with practical advice on how to approach programming, problem-solving, and even your career in tech. It’s not about specific languages, but timeless principles you can apply in any coding environment.\nWhy I recommend it: It helped me refine my approach to coding and problem-solving. The principles in this book have been invaluable in my journey as a developer.\n2. The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth This series is often considered the \u0026ldquo;bible\u0026rdquo; of computer science. It dives deep into algorithms and mathematical foundations that are essential for any software engineer or computer scientist.\nWhy I recommend it: It’s challenging, but mastering the concepts in this book will set you apart as a problem solver in the field of computer science.\n3. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman Kahneman, a Nobel laureate, explores the two systems of thinking that shape our judgments and decision-making. This book offers profound insights into human behavior and decision-making processes.\nWhy I recommend it: It helps improve your ability to think critically and make better decisions, both in life and work.\n4. The Mythical Man-Month by Frederick P. Brooks This book is a collection of essays that discuss the challenges of software project management and the inherent issues that arise when scaling projects. It’s a critical read for anyone involved in team leadership or managing large tech projects.\nWhy I recommend it: The insights in this book helped me understand how to better manage my projects and avoid common pitfalls.\n5. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius A timeless piece of Stoic philosophy. Meditations is a collection of personal writings by the Roman Emperor, offering deep reflections on life, work, and the human condition.\nWhy I recommend it: It’s a great book for practicing mindfulness, self-reflection, and dealing with challenges in a calm and logical manner.\nAdditional Books Coming Soon! I’ll continue to add more books as I read them.\n",

        "tags": ["cybersec",],
        "content": "Introduction Steganography - Comes from the Greek words stegos, meaning roof or covered and graphia which means writing, 1 is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object.\nWe will have a message and carrier in Steganography. Message is the secret data that we want to share that is hidden and Carrier is the material that is being used to send the message. Text Steganography Text Steganography is achieved by altering the text format or by altering the characteristics of the text.\nFor example take first-letter algorithm, it is achieved by taking the first letter of each word of the previous sentence which gives you the hidden message, but this is not effective nor very secure as\nIt is very easy to recognize. It lacks complexity. This is where more advanced forms of text steganography come into play.\nLine-Shift Coding This method is achieved by altering a document by vertically shifting the locations of text lines to encode the document uniquely. 2 We can\u0026rsquo;t really see the difference with our naked eye, but the second line has been shifted up by \u0026lsquo;1/300\u0026rsquo; inch.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at another example. Below, we can clearly see that lines 2 and 5 have been shifted up. Here, we are encoding using binary, where:\nShifted lines = 1 Unshifted lines = 0 This results in the letter \u0026lsquo;H\u0026rsquo;. Similarly, for \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;, lines 2, 5, and 8 are shifted up, representing the binary value \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo;. We don’t essentially need the original text itself; measuring the relative spacing between the lines reveals the secret.\nReferences Steganography - Wikipedia \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nResearchgate \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n",

Initialize LUKS Encryption ⚠️ WARNING: Before we proceed, please make sure you have a BACKUP OF THE DATA somewhere.\nInitialize the LUKS encryption on your partition:\ncryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/sdb2 This command will initialize the partition and will prompt for a passphrase. Please make sure you note the passphrase for further use. 2. Open the Encrypted Partition Create a mapping for the encrypted partition:\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 test Running the following command will prompt for the passphrase you just created. After successful authentication, the encrypted partition will be available at /dev/mapper/test.\n3. Verify the Setup Check the status of your encrypted mapping:\ncryptsetup -v status test To view detailed LUKS header information:\ncryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb2 4. Secure the Partition Fill the entire encrypted volume with zeros to ensure secure initialization:\npv -tpreb /dev/zero | dd of=/dev/mapper/test bs=128M This step will:\nOverwrites the entire partition with zeros This may take some time depending on the size of your device/partition, so we have used the pv command to monitor the progress. 5. Create a File System Format the encrypted partition with ext4 or any file system:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/test 6. Mount and Verify Create a mount point and mount the encrypted partition:\nsudo mkdir /test_device sudo mount /dev/mapper/test /test_device df -H Usage Tips Always keep your passphrase in a secure location\nConsider creating a backup of the LUKS header\nRemember to close the encrypted partition when not in use:\nsudo umount /test_device cryptsetup luksClose test Note: Whenever you see a guide in my blog, they are primarily for my personal documentation, or I am sharing them in hope they might be useful.\n",

        "tags": [],
        "content": "Introduction and Conclusion Despite charging high prices, many online courses fail to provide in-depth knowledge or a personal touch from their creators. There’s a lot of free content on the internet, but it lacks a sense of structure. While platforms like FreeCodeCamp and Khan Academy provide well-structured and highly useful content, I personally don’t feel compelled to learn from them. These platforms have millions of views, yet people still pay for courses that offer the same content.\nThis issue isn’t limited to online platforms. Here in India, people pay thousands of rupees to training centers in the hopes of learning something. I often ask them, \u0026ldquo;What the hell are these guys teaching anyway?\u0026rdquo; As you may have guessed, the content they teach is usually very basic. I understand that you have to learn the basics first, but that alone will not get you a job (which they are promising). Forget about this content being free and accessible on the internet; what they are teaching is of no use! I think it’s the hope these institutions create, the promise of a job or providing references to one that drives people to buy them, not the “actual learning.”\nAnd that’s why I’m thinking of collecting and organizing freely available content from the internet. This will help me as well, so yes. Also I don’t consider myself an expert on any of these topics I plan to present, but I will try my best to make them well-structured. And yes, you should pay me $100 per topic to unlock it (jk!).\nI have no idea how long I will stick with this idea. Let’s see.\n",
